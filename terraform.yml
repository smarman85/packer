Terraform:
  - tool for building, changing and versioning infrastructure saftely and efficiently
  - config files describe components needed to run a single app or entire datacenter
  - can manage low level components like (instances, storage, networking) 
    as well as high level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc

  - Key featrues:
    Infrastructure as Code:
      described using high-level config syntax
        allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated
        as you would any other code
      can be shared and reuesd

    Execution Plans:
      "planning" step generates an execution plan

      the plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply
      avoid surprises

    Resource Graph:
      Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification
      of any non-dependaent resources.
      Terraform builds infrastructure as effciently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies
      in their infrastructure

    Change Automation:
      Avoid human interaction as much as possible
      execution plan lets you know exactly what will change
